I was messing around on Bluesky before work (because I can't do anything productive for anyone else before I've done something for myself) and I saw [something unexpected](https://bsky.app/profile/retr0.id/post/3lchobcfu3s2f):

That part's pretty standard, obviously; it's when I poked my head around in there to see how the conversation could shift so dramatically that I ran into [the weirdness](https://bsky.app/profile/starshine.bsky.social/post/3lchv4mknzs2m). I always thought the Bluesky block was apocalyptic, severing every tendon that connected you to whoever was on the receiving end, but here I get to see that there's some remainder there.

There's no guarantee it'll render the same way for anyone else; this whole situation could just be because I have one person blocked that no one else in the chain does, and obviously Bluesky isn't going to "sever all the ties that bind" when I'm just a viewing member. 

Is this worth bothering anyone about? Probably not, but seeing as my current readership is negligible, this is roughly the same as journaling.
