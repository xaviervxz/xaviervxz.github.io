I'm just adding in a lil bit of html:
<body>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ncase/nutshell/nutshell.js"></script>
<h2>Nutshell Test</h2>
<p>We're testing a <a href="#nutshelltest">:local nutshell</a> here, and an <a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/#CaveatOnLinking">:external nutshell</a> here! </p>
</body>

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
