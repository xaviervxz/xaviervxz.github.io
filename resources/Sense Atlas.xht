            <p>The overarching goal of <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> is to support people at work by providing maps of <dfn>structured information</dfn> related to specific projects, the <dfn>business ecosystem</dfn>, and the surrounding information environment at large.</p>

              <h4 property="dct:title">Robust and powerful shared information space</h4>
              <p>Great care has been taken to design <a rel="dct:references" href="https://intertwingler.net/" typeof="bibo:Website">the system underlying <span rel="dct:references" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span></a> to <strong>never break a link</strong>.

              <p>Simply put, <strong>documents make lousy documentation</strong>.
 They get misplaced, they go stale, they have poor internal 
addressability, and frankly, in a business setting, they are often just 
plain too much to read.</p>
              <p>A linear narrative may be essential for <em>persuasion</em>, but when you've already bought in, just the facts will do. Not <em>just</em> the facts, actually, but facts connected in <em>space</em>, by well-defined <dfn>semantic relations</dfn>.

            <h2 property="dct:title">Domains</h2>
            <p><span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> currently supports mapping the following thematic domains:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Concepts</dt>
              <dd>Organizations run much more smoothly when people use 
the same words to mean the same things. It's doubly important that 
customers, constituents, and users understand what you mean when you say
 certain words. The <strong>concept scheme module</strong> is therefore a workspace for structuring taxonomies of concepts and reconciling understandings of terminology.</dd>
              <dt>Issues</dt>
              <dd>An <em>issue</em> is nothing more than a state of 
affairs in the world that needs something done about it. Software 
developers have had issue trackers for decades; this is an issue tracker
 for issues that are bigger than software. The <a rel="ci:mentions" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system"><strong>issue-based information system</strong></a> module is the beating heart of <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span>, and the original module that spurred its development.</dd>
              <dt>Projects</dt>
              <dd>A <em>project</em> can be viewed as <em>graduating</em> a set of issues into <em>goals</em> and their associated <em>tasks</em>, along with concrete <em>targets</em> for completing those tasks. The <strong>project planning</strong> module, which is currently under active development, can be used for conventional resource planning, <em>or</em> for <a rel="ci:mentions" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSjxr8xG6A">a novel value-based methodology</a>.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>There are several more domains in the pipe and coming in hot:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt id="corporate-social-network">Corporate social network analysis</dt>
              <dd>There is enormous value in mapping out the entities—and <em>types</em> of entities—present in a <dfn>business ecosystem</dfn>,
 as well as how they relate to each other. This includes partners, 
vendors, competitors, institutions, governments and regulatory bodies, 
their key people, their products, and so on.</dd>
              <dt id="bibliographic-records">Bibliographic records</dt>
              <dd>Organizations tend to reference a number of 
information resources in their projects, internal policy documents, and 
external communications. It is valuable not only to concentrate these 
and make them available to everybody in your organization, but also link
 them back to the places from which they are referenced.</dd>
              <dt>Content strategy</dt>
              <dd>Organizations tend to produce a lot of content, both 
for internal consumption as well as communicating with customers, users,
 and the general public. This module will ease the process of creating 
content inventories for subsequent audits, as well as afford modeling 
audience segments to reconcile with existing and future content.</dd>
              
              <dt>Plain-vanilla notes</dt>
              <dd><dfn>Personal knowledge management</dfn> software has demonstrated the value of being able to attach notes to anything, including other notes. As such, <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> will implement ordinary notes that you can attach to anything—<em>including other notes</em>—and effectively act as a note <em>server</em> for resources outside of <span about="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService" property="gr:name">Sense Atlas</span>.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>While these modules are useful on their own, the real power is in putting them <em>together</em>. Furthermore, in principle, <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> can represent any mix of <dfn>linked data vocabularies</dfn>, either <a rel="dct:references" href="https://lov.linkeddata.es/" typeof="bibo:Website">off the shelf</a>, or <a rel="dct:references" href="https://vocab.methodandstructure.com/" typeof="bibo:Website">purpose-made</a>.

 that is specific to software development, only that software 
development tends to feature a large number of interacting concerns that
 requires a structure like <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> to faithfully represent.</p>
            <p>For example, anybody who undertakes complex projects can benefit from the planning modules, like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Architects</li>
              <li>Engineers</li>
              <li>Building contractors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <abbr>IBIS</abbr> module works just as well for 
policy analysis—including contracts, treaties, and legislation—as it 
does for design rationale. This makes it useful for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lawyers</li>
              <li>Risk managers</li>
              <li>Think-tankers</li>
              <li>Unions</li>
              <li>Professional associations</li>
            </ul>

              <h3 property="dct:title">Priorities</h3>
              <p><span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span>
 is brand-new software. Development priorities for the first year will 
be set in conjunction with the needs of the participants of the private 
alpha program. Notwithstanding, here are some themes where work is 
immediately planned:</p>
              <dl>
                <dt>Response time</dt>
                <dd><span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> is using a specific development technique, and running on top of <a href="https://intertwingler.net/">a novel application server</a>. It was important to first get it running <em>correctly</em>, without compromising certain architectural constraints. Now that it <em>works</em>, the focus can shift to speeding it up.</dd>
                <dt>Collections</dt>
                <dd>The collection pages—concept schemes and issue networks—are still extremely bare-bones, and are slated to get a proper glow-up.</dd>
                <dt>Global edit history</dt>
                <dd>Because <em>all</em> state data of <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> is fully addressable, it should be possible in principle to undo <em>any</em>
 change, all the way back to the first interaction. The plan is to 
implement a transaction history directly into the underlying 
database—where it belongs—and to do this soon.</dd>
                <dt>Attachments</dt>
                <dd>While <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span>
 is not intended to serve as yet another file repository, it is 
obviously useful to see things like link previews, profile pictures, and
 other opaque data objects. These capabilities are all routed through 
the same infrastructure in the underlying application server as what 
handles the internal caching, already mentioned as another high-priority
 item.</dd>
                <dt>Integrations</dt>
                <dd><span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span>
 recognizes that other applications and information services exist in 
the world, and that many of them are popular. We will be targeting a few
 essential integrations (conventional bug trackers, cloud storage 
services, etc.) during the private alpha, pending input from clients.</dd>
                <dt>Alternative visualizations</dt>
                <dd><span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> uses an innovative hyperbolic radial <a rel="ci:mentions" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_graph_drawing">Sugiyama layout</a>
 for its main visualization, which is under active development. We 
recognize, moreover, that there are situations where other visual 
representations are more appropriate.</dd>
                <dt>Accessibility</dt>
                <dd><span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> uses a colourful palette to delineate all the different entities and relationships. Marshalling the palette at <em>all</em>
 was a challenge, though plans are in place to create palettes that 
account for the different—and mutually conflicting—forms of colour 
blindness. Screen reader support is likewise planned, pending a strategy
 to coalesce accessibility metadata with existing embedded semantic 
metadata.</dd>
                <dt>Real-time collaboration</dt>
                <dd>Since <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> is ultimately a collaborative tool, support real-time updates to the <dfn>knowledge graph</dfn> state, so you can see when others on your team change something.</dd>

              <h3 property="dct:title">Non-priorities</h3>
              <dl>
                <dt>Mobile interface</dt>
                <dd>A proper treatment for mobile is going to have to 
figure out how to cram a metric tonne of information onto a tiny screen.
 There is a lot of stuff flying around right now, and it's going to have
 to settle down a bit first before serious thought is given to 
mobile—though serious thought <em>will</em> be given to mobile.</dd>
                <dt>Artificial intelligence</dt>
                <dd><span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> is a tool for supporting <em>your</em> intelligence. While <em>you</em> could easily pump out your instance data and do <abbr>AI</abbr> things to it, and while there may be certain applicability for <abbr>AI</abbr> in the future, there is currently very little <em>within</em> <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> for <abbr>AI</abbr> to do.</dd>
                <dt>Whizz-bang visual effects</dt>
                <dd>Cutesy animations are extraordinarily time-consuming
 to implement and will only be considered for the time being if they 
solve a more substantive problem in the interface.</dd>
                <dt>Server round-trips</dt>
                <dd>The prototype that preceded <span rel="ci:mentions" resource="urn:uuid:4a540602-8ccc-40a5-8bb3-927cf5486d65" typeof="gr:ProductOrService">Sense Atlas</span> was developed initially to test <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/rdf-kv">a lightweight protocol</a> for manipulating knowledge graph data using only ordinary <abbr>HTML</abbr>
 forms. While the interaction is not as smooth as client-side scripting 
affords, this keeps the number of moving parts down when both the data 
schema and the interface to display and control it are in flux. We can 
easily replace it with the slicker interaction as these concerns 
stiffen.</dd>
