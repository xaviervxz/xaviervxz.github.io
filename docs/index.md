Welcome to the Campaign! My name is Vincent Xavier Zell, and I'm running for President of (whatever is left of) the United States in 2036.

## Why Should Anyone Run At All?

Because society only works if everyone does their part. There's the obviously useful tasks that we need people doing 
(like [teaching](policies/education), [shipping](policies/logistics), or [construction](policies/infrasctructure)), 
but there are many tasks that are further away from a humanist worldview. 
<!-- If you've ever wondered why someone in Silicon Valley is spending a billion dollars to automate home-made cookies || saving this because I think the metaphor can be salvaged -->
It's hard _not_ to see people making decisions that favor themselves over the people and projects they're supposed to be
taking responsibility for, but it's easier to criticise than it is to throw your hat in the ring.

And you, a random resident of the United States of America, are more qualified to make decisions for the people of this
country than any of the avaricious husks that are trying to drain everyone else's pocketbooks. You've struggled;
cared for your family, friends, and neighbors; and seen more of Real America than any of our disconnected ruling class.

Get involved! [Run For Something](https://runforsomething.net/) needs people across the country, and only by reaching out
can you see how much you can help.

## Ok, But Why Should YOU run for anything?

Because I'm:
- Proud (of my strengths, which I'll list here)
- Humble (of my many faults, which I won't)
- Clever (I made this website and, as of 2025, all my graphics)
- Aggressive (I love fighting for its own sake)
- and Giving (to each according to their need)

## I Can't Help but Notice that Rich, Connected, and Popular Aren't on that list.

That's why I'm running a decade-long campaign. I don't think it'll be easy, but that doesn't mean we can't at least try it.

## But President?

Yep! 

## Isn't that kind of delusional?

That's the lovely thing about a Democracy. It's only insane until 10% of the population agrees with you. ;)
