Hey Vince,


There is nothing there.

Any content you can find isn't what you're looking for.

You cannot heal malnutrition with sawdust

You cannot build a house by looking at the remains of the Romans

There is nothing in the places you've been trained to look

Because what you're looking for can't come from somewhere else

- Vince
