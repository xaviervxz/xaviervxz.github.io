Zell 2036's Position on Logistics

## Problem Statement

Moving anything costs, either in the gas a commuter spends, the energy a biker has to keep up, or 
the mainenance costs of the infrastructure that everything except Birds use to get around. Minimizing
as many of those costs as possible frees Americans to travel as they wish, sell goods across the
world, and trust that they won't have to go without.

I favor Trains.

### Policy Proposal
<!-- How can Trains solve this problem? -->

### Definition of Success
<!-- How will we know that the policy works? -->
