Zell 2036's Position on Civic Duty

## Problem Statement

I believe that people want to work, and to be recognized for the work that they've done.
In order to accomplish this, I'd propose a program of National Service that would provide
young adults with training for a career of national value.

This program would encourage Americans from across the country to come together to build
something to be proud of.

### Policy Proposal
<!-- How can Trains solve this problem? -->

### Definition of Success
<!-- How will we know that the policy works? -->
