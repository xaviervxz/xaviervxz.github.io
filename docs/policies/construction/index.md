Zell 2036's Position on Construction

## Problem Statement

Haphazard building has the potential to create problems decades down the line, but 
refusing to build national construction capacity means that knowledge of the industry
will decay, making the American Growth that is _necessary_ to maintain hegemony will
cause us to burn ourselves down.

Housing is a right, and there should b federal teams tasked with building enough 
for all Americans to contribute to the dream of a Land of the Free.

### Policy Proposal
