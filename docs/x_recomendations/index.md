title: Things I Like

Joy's nearly as powerful a motivator as Spite, so here's some links to things I love.

## Free Stuff!

Here's an [RSS feed](rss-no-nsfw-20250823.opml) with a lot of my nonsense. I follow a lot of things on Patreon,
but I'm too lazy to find out how to make that into aneasily exportable list.

I use [Feedbro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feedbroreader/), because I've tried a few over
the years as they get better or worse. 

I'll think about explaining each of them if anyone pings me, but it'd also be a lovely excuse to write for the
[Webcomic Travelogue](https://webcomictravelogue.com/discover/).

## TV that I want to talk about

??? tip "Scavenger's Reign"
	also common side effects, but really, it's all about Scavenger.

??? tip "Bigtop Burger"
	A decade ago, I don't think I would have counted this as television, but it has better voices, animation,
	music, dialogue, and plot than almost anything else Ive seen. It helps that the episodes are tiny, dense,
	and take an eternity to come out :P

## Videogames that I Have Played a Lot Of

??? tip "Europa Universalis 4"
	It has its faults, but anything this ambitious would _have_ to, and 
	the team over at Paradox deserves a ridiculus amount of respect for trying to _accurately_
	simulate one of the most tumuvtuous periods of human history without forgetting to make 
	that sim fun. I stopped playing a few years back (it demands a lot from you) but I'm
	looking forward to EU5 with bated breath.

??? tip "Crop Rotation"
	because it's adorable and clever

??? tip "Islanders"
	I like putting things in spots and getting points. Islanders has enough texture that every 
	building placemnt is a puzzle without being so precise that you have to worry about doing
	it wrong.

### ...but some anti-recommends

??? danger "The Bazaar"
	Someimes you play a game, and sometimes the game plays you.

??? danger "Civilization (3-6)"
	I feel the same way about this and Settlers ot Catan; I'll play them if someone else wants to,
	but it's because of the friendship, not the game.
