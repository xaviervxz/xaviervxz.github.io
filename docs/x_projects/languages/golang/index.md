## Course Notes, by Section

### Section 1: Setup
1. instructor says he's helpful
2. zip file full of diagrams, they're the same as the lecture's images???? 
3. not gonna join your community, bro
4. Installers are for chumps. I used `brew install golang`
5. already have it
6. I really would just like this in text. listening to a 3.5 min video is silly.
	- looks like I need a diff Go extension; maybe it's the same one, but Google subsumed it.
	- Wasn't asked to install any additional tools
7. a nice warning! might mean that there's reused names from lesson to lesson


### Section 2: Simple Start
mostly just explaining Hello World

8. oh I am NOT excited to see this just start with naked files. 
	- script in [first_file.go]
	- doesn't tell me how to run it??
		??? error
			can't do `go first_file.go`, it's gotta be `go run first_file.go`
9. I'll listen to the guy now
	- CLI Options:
		- `run`: compile & execute
		- `build`: just compile, leave an executable artifact
		- `fmt`: Formats code; linter
		- `install`: packages
		- `get`: packages
		- `test`: can't wa't for unit testing, v glad it's a builtin
10. oh yeah, this is all going to be reusing Main repeatedly. 
	- `go build` doesn't create exe files unless the file has `package main`
11. [[https://golang.org/pkg]]
12. I'm familiar w/ Java
13. Aced quiz, doing all my notes here instead


### Section 3: Real Code
looks like some cards, a CLASSIC code problem. gonna reuse the First File, but in the cards directory.

14. Problem Statement
15. did it
- variables! I think my syntax highlighter isn't up to snuff, and autocomplete isn't working either
- ALL FUTURE KNOWLEDGE CONTAINED WITHIN cards DIRECTORY
