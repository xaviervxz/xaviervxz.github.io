Thought I'd list a few things I'm working on!

----
## Websites and Servers

- This Site! It's built in MkDocs because I don't need anything fancier, and hosted on Github Pages while I get my own server up and running.
- I'm working on spinning up my own instance of [Tangled's](https://tangled.sh/@tangled.sh/core) spindles and Knots so that I can stop hosting this thing on Github.
